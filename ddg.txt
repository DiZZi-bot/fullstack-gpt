What Does the Backdoor Do? Malicious code added to xz Utils versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 modified the way the software functions. The backdoor manipulated sshd, the executable file used to make remote ... That operation matches the style of the XZ Utils backdoor far more than the cruder supply chain attacks of APT41 or Lazarus, by comparison. "It could very well be someone else," says Aitel. A malicious code inserted into a Linux compression tool by a developer named JiaT75 could have compromised millions of systems via SSH. A Microsoft worker discovered the backdoor and alerted the open source community, preventing a major disaster. A backdoor was planted in the XZ utils package, a popular open-source compression utility for Linux/UNIX systems, by a threat actor named JiaT75. The backdoor exploited the SSH protocol to gain remote access and control over affected devices. The xz-utils package, used by many Linux distributions, had a backdoor that could compromise sshd authentication. Learn how to check and update your Kali installation to avoid this issue.
